<h2>Background</h2>
Data mining involves extracting meaningful patterns and insights from large datasets. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a popular method for classification and regression in data mining. It classifies data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors. This project aims to provide a user-friendly web application to perform data mining tasks using the KNN algorithm.
<h2>Key Features</h2>
Data Upload and Management: Users can upload datasets and manage their data through the web interface.
KNN Classification: Implements the KNN algorithm for classifying data points based on their nearest neighbors.
Parameter Adjustment: Allows users to adjust parameters such as the number of neighbors (k) and distance metrics.
Visualization: Provides visualization of the classification results and data distributions.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive web interface for performing data mining tasks.
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
PHP 8: Used for application logic and server-side processing.
MySQL: Used for storing datasets and user information.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for developing the user interface.
Bootstrap: Used for responsive design and layout.

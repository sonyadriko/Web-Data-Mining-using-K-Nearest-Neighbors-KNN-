<h2>Background</h2>
Data mining involves extracting meaningful patterns and insights from large datasets. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a popular method for classification and regression in data mining. It classifies data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors. This project aims to provide a user-friendly web application to perform data mining tasks using the KNN algorithm.

<ol>
  <li>Data Upload and Management: Users can upload datasets and manage their data through the web interface.</li>
  <li>KNN Classification: Implements the KNN algorithm for classifying data points based on their nearest neighbors.</li>
  <li>Parameter Adjustment: Allows users to adjust parameters such as the number of neighbors (k) and distance metrics.</li>
  <li>Visualization: Provides visualization of the classification results and data distributions.</li>
  <li>User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive web interface for performing data mining tasks.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PHP 8: Used for application logic and server-side processing.</li>
  <li>MySQL: Used for storing datasets and user information.</li>
